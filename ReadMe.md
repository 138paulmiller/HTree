# Huffman Tree 
	C++ class demonstrating Huffman encoding and decoding by generating a Huffman Tree.
	- The Huffman tree is a set of Symbol, frequency pairs. 
	- Each symbol, frequency pair is added to the tree, 
	after all pairs are added the code map is generated by heapifying the set.
	- Heapify : The two pairs with the smallest frequencies are removed from the set, merged into an
	internal pair whose freq = the sum of each pairs frequency. 
	- The merged pair is then added to the set.

## Encoding/Decoding
Demonstration with an example data string
- Data:
	Hello! I am a Huffman tree

- Encoded Data:	
	0110 101 0101 0101 00101 00100 11 00011 11 100 0100 
	11 100 11 0110 00010 0011 0011 0100 100 00001 11 00000 
	0111 101 101 

- Decoded Data:
	Hello! I am a Huffman tree
