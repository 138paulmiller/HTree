#Huffman Tree 
	C++ class demonstrating Huffman encoding and decoding by generating a Huffman Tree.
	-The Huffman tree is a set of Symbol, frequency pairs. 
	-Each symbol, frequency pair is added to the tree, 
	after all pairs are added the code map is generated by heapifying the set.
	-Heapify : The two pairs with the smallest frequencies are removed from the set, merged into an
	internal pair whose freq = the sum of each pairs frequency. 
	This merged pair is then added to the set.

##Example Encoding/Decoding and Code Table
Data:
Mary had a little lamb

Encoded Data:
1111 001 1110 1101 000 1100 001 1011 000 001 000 011 1010 0100 0100 011 1001 000 011 001 1000 0101 

Decoded Data:
Mary had a little lamb

Code Table:
